I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Jiantao Jiao](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jiantao/). Previously, I graduated from [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/) at Tsinghua University.

My research interests focus on machine learning theory, theoretical computer science and game theory.
